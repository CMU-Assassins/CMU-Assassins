                li To assassinate your target, you must tag them with a spoon. For the tag to be valid, the assassin must be touching the spoon directly. For example, if a spoon is thrown, or the spoon is attached to something else that the assassin is holding, the tag is invalid.
                li After a player assassinates his target, his new target will be his old targetâ€™s target.

                li You may not be tagged on your way to or from showers or the sign-in table AS LONG AS you are not carrying a spoon.
