        li After the game begins, you will be assigned a target, and someone else will be assigned you as their target.
        li For a spoon to be valid, it must be made of plastic and be no longer than seven inches. The easiest way to obtain a valid spoon is to take one from Resnik.
        li To assassinate your target, you must tag them with a valid spoon. For your tag to be valid, you and your target must be touching the spoon directly. Invalid tags include, but are not limited to: throwing a spoon, attaching a spoon to something else (including another spoon) to make a chain, and tagging your target without using a spoon.
        li If you tag your assassin, your assassin is stunned for 3 hours and cannot tag you during that time.
        li If you do not assassinate your target after 2 days, you will be eliminated due to inactivity. Your assassins will not receive extra time to assassinate his target.
        li When you are assassinated, your assassin is given your target.
